<h2 style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center">2021 – German HCI @ Virtual CHI</h2>

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s CHI will be an online virtual conference (May 8-13, 2021). In order to honor the tradition of the German HCI event, we curated this website to provide details of this year’s publications from the involved labs.
