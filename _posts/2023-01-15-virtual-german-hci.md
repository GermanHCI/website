During CHI 2021, we will host a __virtual German HCI Space__ on Gather. Within this space, we will exhibit the publications of the contributing labs and provide space to __meet and chat.__

__How to join:__

We are hosting the German HCI Space on Gather.

## Schedule
Our virtual German HCI space is available during the whole CHI conference – you can simply join at any time! In addition, we host some special events at specific times:

#### GermanHCI Party
We will be hosting a virtual GermanHCI party on Wednesday, May 12, 8 pm CEST. We have prepared some games and many areas to hangout. So, grab a drink, join us, and let’s have a good time.

#### Lab Lunches
Our space is open for Lab Lunches throughout the CHI 2021 conference: Monday – Wednesday, 1 pm CEST. You can meet people from our labs and chat about their research.

## Using Gather
Gather (https://gather.town) is a web-conferencing tool like Zoom. However, with Gather, you are in a virtual space that allows you to walk around, interact, and talk with other participants that are close to you, just like in real life.

We created spaces for all contributing labs where you can have a look at their publications at CHI 2021 and directly start a conversation with authors and other lab members. Additionally, you can meet your peers in three socializing rooms (there is a bar, a game room, and a coffee shop) or run across a friend in our virtual corridors.

In Gather, you control an avatar using the arrow-keys of your keyboard to move in our virtual space. If you are close to another person (i.e., their avatar), your camera and microphone are activated and you can talk to each other, similarly to other web-conferencing tools like Zoom. Walking away from each other ends this conversation. If you are close to an interactive object (e.g., a video showcase), you can watch it by simply pressing the ‘x’ button on your keyboard – but no worries, Gather will provide you with information on possible actions. In addition, we have listed the most important hints in the following:

- Video chats automatically start with the avatars that are close to you
- In private areas (often marked with carpet), the video chat is activate with all others in this area
- Looking for someone? Click on a person in the participants list and click ‘locate’ to find the right way
- Press ‘x’ to activate interactive objects (e.g., videos, posters, games, …)
- Press ‘g’ to enter ghost mode – then, you can move through other people and are not blocked anymore
- Press ‘Ctrl’+’U’ to activate quite mode – then, video chats are only started when avatars are directly next to you
- And, most importantly: keep ‘z’ pressed to let you avatar dance!
- Feel free to have a look at the official Gather 101 to get the most out of your Gather experience.
