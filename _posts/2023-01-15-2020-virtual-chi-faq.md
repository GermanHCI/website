- By default, only panelists (i.e., session chairs & authors) are un-muted and shown with video.
- Attendees may also try to get the chairs’ attention during Q&A by raising their hand via the offered Zoom functionality.

- __Q&A:__ Please ask questions using the Zoom Q&A (session chairs will introduce it during the panel discussion). Please skim the existing questions and vote questions up that are similar.
