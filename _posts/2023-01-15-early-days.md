The history of events organized by Germans at CHI is long and started way before the labs joined forces under the German HCI flag. In the early days, the Käse & Wein (cheese & wine) parties organized by Jan Borchers from RWTH Aachen marked the starting point:

Invitation to the 2014 edition of “Käse & Wein”
Similar to 2013, the event was again organized by Jan Borchers, Floyd Mueller, and Jürgen Steimle, this time joined by Lennart Nacke (University of Waterloo). That year’s location was the Fionn MacCool’s – Front Street (Pub) and about 300 people were invited.

## 2015 & 2016
In 2015 and 2016, the Cheese & Wine parties took a break and no German events happened. At the 2016 CHI in San Jose, Thijs Roumen and Patrick Baudisch from the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) took the initiative to revive the tradition of a German network event and started to reach out to other German labs. Eventually, this effort resulted in the first German HCI event as we currently know it in Denver in 2017—with over 600 invites sent out.
