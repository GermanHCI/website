Most business owners use content managements systems to manage their websites. Yet, those can pose security risks and provide vulnerabilities for manipulations. With vulnerability notifications, website owners are notified about security risks. To identify common themes with respect to vulnerability notifications and provide deeper insight into the motivations of website owners to react to those notifications, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews. In compliance with previous research, we could confirm that distrust in unexpected notifications is high and, in contrast to previous research, we suggest that verification possibilities are the most important factors to establish trust in notifications. We also endorse the findings that raising awareness for the severity and the complexity of the problems is crucial to increase remediation rates.","Late Breaking Work","","published","ACM CHI"

Eye tracking allows overcoming these obstacles by enabling augmentation of remote meetings with gaze information. In this project, we followed a participatory approach by first distributing a scenario-based survey to students (n=79) to uncover their preference of eye-based joint attention support (real-time, retrospective, real-time & retrospective, no) for remote university meetings. Building on these findings, we developed EyeMeet, an eye-based joint attention support system that combines state-of-the-art real-time joint attention support with a retrospective attention feedback for remote meetings. In a four-week study, two student groups worked remotely on course assignments using EyeMeet. Our findings of the study highlight that EyeMeets supports students in staying more focused on the meetings. Complementing real-time joint attention support, retrospective joint attention feedback is recognized to provide valuable support for reflecting and adapting behavior for upcoming meetings.","Late Breaking Work","","published",""

ONYX introduces an interactive task learning (ITL) based approach which enables NLIs to learn from users through natural interactions. Users can personalize the NLI with new commands using direct manipulation, known commands, or by combining both. To further support users during the training process, we derived two design goals for the user interface, namely providing suggestions based on sub-parts of the command and addressing ambiguities through follow-up questions and instantiated them in ONYX. In order to trigger reflections and gain feedback on possible design trade-offs of ONYX and the instantiated design goals, we performed a formative user study to understand how to successfully integrate the suggestions and follow-up question into the interaction.","Late Breaking Work","","published",""

However, with rapid technological advancements in multiple disciplines, we see a need to synthesize the main open research questions and opportunities for the HCI community to advance future research in this area. By systematically analyzing Epidermal Devices contributed in the HCI community, physical sciences research and from our experiences in designing and building Epidermal Devices, we identify opportunities and challenges for advancing research across five themes.

To provide a wide range of matching sensations of being touched or stroked, current approaches typically need large numbers of different physical textures. However, even advanced devices can only accommodate a limited number of textures to remain wearable. Therefore, a better understanding is necessary of how expectations elicited by different visualizations affect haptic perception, to achieve a balance between physical constraints and great variety of matching physical textures. In this work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness is affected within VR. We designed a prototype for arm stroking and compared the effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations' real-world materials, no-haptics and vibrotactile feedback as baselines. As one result, we found that two levels of roughness can be sufficient to convey a realistic illusion.""","Full Paper","","published",""

In this article, we establish a categorization of individually verifiable Internet voting schemes based on voter interactions. For each category in our proposed categorization, we evaluate a voting scheme in a user study with a total of 100 participants.

To investigate these aspects, we implemented two types of VR pair-learning systems, a symmetric system with both peers using VR and an asymmetric system with one using a tablet. In a user study (N=46), the symmetric system statistically significantly provided higher presence, immersion, player experience, and lower intrinsic cognitive load, which are all important for learning.

We found that handlebar steering leads to the lowest VR sickness without decreasing cycling performance and airflow suggests to be the most promising method to reduce VR sickness for all three types of trajectories.","Full Paper","","published",""

However, teleportation with parabolic and linear target aiming methods is restricted to horizontal 2D planes and it is unknown how they transfer to the 3D space. In this paper, we propose six 3D teleportation methods in virtual environments based on the combination of two existing aiming methods (linear and parabolic) and three types of transitioning to a target (instant, interpolated and continuous). To investigate the performance of the proposed teleportation methods, we conducted a controlled lab experiment (N = 24) with a mid-air coin collection task to assess accuracy, efficiency and VR sickness. We discovered that the linear aiming method leads to faster and more accurate target selection. Moreover, a combination of linear aiming and instant transitioning leads to the highest efficiency and accuracy without increasing VR sickness.","Full Paper, Honorable Mention","","published",""

To understand existing practices in the field, this paper examines 110 publications, exploring domains, applications, modalities, mental states and processes, and more. This analysis reveals variance in how authors report experiments, which creates challenges to understand, reproduce, and build on that research. It then describes an overarching experiment model that provides a formal structure for reporting HCI research with brain signals, including definitions, terminology, categories, and examples for each aspect. Multiple distinct reporting styles were identified through factor analysis and tied to different types of research. The paper concludes with recommendations and discusses future challenges. This creates actionable items from the abstract model and empirical observations to make HCI research with brain signals more reproducible and reusable.","Journal","","published",""

This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, “outdated technologies.” In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.","Late Breaking Work","","published",""

The framework locates a system in the spectrum of providing realistic or abstract haptic feedback using the Haptic Fidelity dimension. It comprises 14 criteria that either describe foundational or limiting factors. A second Versatility dimension captures the current trade-off between highly realistic but application-specific and more abstract but widely applicable feedback.

When participants approached six virtual agents (i.e., two males, two females, a humanoid robot, and a pillar) to ask for directions, we found that participants respected the agents' PS and modulated interpersonal distances according to the human-like agents' perceived gender. When participants were instructed to walk through the agents, we observed heightened skin-conductance levels that indicate physiological arousal. These results are discussed in terms of proxemic theory that result in design recommendations for implementing pervasive AR experiences with virtual agents.","Full Paper","","published",""

While DES is well-studied in computer displays, its impact on users of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) is largely unexplored—despite that some of their key properties (e.g., the vergence-accommodation conflict) make VR-HMDs particularly prone. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation into DES in VR HMDs. We present results from a survey with 68 experienced users to understand DES symptoms in VR-HMDs. To help address DES, we investigate eye exercises resulting from survey answers and blue light filtering in three user studies (N = 71). Results demonstrate that eye exercises, but not blue light filtering, can effectively reduce DES. We conclude with an extensive analysis of the user studies and condense our findings in 10 key challenges that guide future work in this emerging research area.","Journal","","published",""

However, it is not well understood how technology-mediated smell can support social interactions, especially in collaborative tasks. To explore its effect on collaboration, we asked eleven pairs of users to work together on a writing task while wearing an interactive jewellery designed to emit scent in a controlled fashion. In a within-subjects experiment, participants were asked to collaboratively write a story about a standardized visual stimulus while exposed to with scent and without scent conditions. We analyzed video recordings and written stories using a combination of methods from HCI, psychology, sociology, and human communication research. We observed differences in both participants' communication and creation of insightful stories in the with scent condition. Furthermore, scent helped participants recover from communication breakdown even though they were unaware of it. We discuss the possible implications of our findings and the potential of technology-mediated scent for collaborative activities.","Late Breaking Work","","published",""

Nevertheless, HCI has little insight into how technological mediation influences religious experiences and how technology should be designed for use in religious contexts. Therefore, we see a unique opportunity to understand better real-world experiences of technology use in religious rituals and, more specifically, in online worship services. Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers' needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.","Late Breaking Work","","published",""
