description: "The Human-Computer Interaction (HC) research group is part of the Department of Informatics at the Faulty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences at the Universität Hamburg (UHH). Our group is particularly interested in developing innovative user interfaces for computer-mediated blended realities in which the two-dimensional digital world and intelligence meets human intelligence and the three-dimensional physical world we live in. In our group we combine methods from computer science (software development, in particular computer graphics and artificial intelligence), engineering (hardware prototyping, in particular with sensors and actuators for novel user interface technology) and basic principles and models of psychology (such as perception, cognition or action) as well as interaction design (e.g. usability and user experience engineering) to reform the future interaction between humans and technology. The results advance the state-of-the-art in basic research, applied research, and experimental development in the area of augmented/virtual reality, virtual agents and avatars, and 3D user interfaces as well as spatial user interaction. The results can be applied in a variety of application domains such as health, simulation, training, communication, entertainment, education or training."
