We propose the use of visuo-haptic illusions alongside physical proxies to enhance the scope of proxy-based interactions with virtual objects. In this work, we focus on two manipulation techniques, linear translation and stretching across different distances, and investigate how much discrepancy between the physical proxy and the virtual object may be introduced without participants noticing. In a study with 24 participants, we found that manipulation technique and travel distance significantly affect the detection thresholds, and that visuo-haptic illusions impact performance and accuracy. We show that this technique can be used to enable functional proxy objects that act as stand-ins for multiple virtual objects, illustrating the technique through a showcase VR-DJ application."

Such techniques modify a user's hand movements and have been successfully used to enhance haptics and 3D user interfaces. Up to now, however, no unified framework exists that implements previously proposed techniques such as body warping, world warping, and hybrid methods. In this work, we present the Virtual Reality Hand Redirection Toolkit (HaRT), an open-source framework developed for the Unity engine. The toolkit aims to support both novice and expert VR researchers and practitioners in implementing and evaluating hand redirection techniques. It provides implementations of popular redirection algorithms and exposes a modular class hierarchy for easy integration of new approaches. Moreover, simulation, logging, and visualization features allow users of the toolkit to analyze hand redirection setups with minimal technical effort. We present the architecture of the toolkit along with the results of a qualitative expert study."

Driven by the emerging field of Human-Food Interaction and novel phenomena on social media such as Finstas, ASMR, Mukbang and live streaming, we would like to highlight the significance of food influencers as influential content creators and their social media practices. We have conducted a qualitative interview study and analyzed over 1,500 posts of food content creators on Instagram, focusing on practices of content creation, photography, staging, posting, and use of technology. Based on our findings, we have derived a process model that outlines the practices of this rather small, but influential user group. We contribute to the field of HCI by outlining the practices of food influencers as influential content creators within the social media sphere to open up design spaces for interaction researchers and practitioners."

Collective activities like brainstorming and sensemaking often use space for arranging documents and information and thus will likely benefit from AR-enhanced offices. Until now, there has been very little research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room's vertical surfaces as well as the room's furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization. We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage spaces specifically for collaboration."

We reflect on the role of pre-existing care practices amongst our community collaborators, and a continued openness throughout the project, that allowed a complex constellation of actors to be involved in its ongoing maintenance and our own, often mundane activities which have contributed to the sustainability of the results. Situating our account within an HCI for Social Justice agenda, we thereby contribute to an ongoing discussion about the sustainability of such activities."

When planning the workshop, we will also reflect on social situations that can result in vulnerabilities for participants. Therefore, we will ensure that interested participants will experience low barriers to participation include a variety of people with different backgrounds and ensure that interaction happens based on equality principles and in an atmosphere of solidarity. Participants can exchange ideas and thoughts without worrying about being exposed to biased assumptions. The workshop will allow for non-hierarchical and cooperative discussion and collaboration through interactive online exercises, resulting in a collaboratively developed zine.

However, turning off CLS can then raise suspicions. To address this, we developed nuanced sharing settings in a focus group (N = 6) and implemented them to moderate CLS in an Android app. Crucially, the app also discloses each person's current sharing settings to the partner. In a 16-day field study, four couples interacted with our app and the disclosed configurations, confirming the disclosure's positive effect on transparency. However, features obfuscating the location were considered superfluous, as participants preferred sharing their location exactly or not at all. While participants overall appreciated having the configuration options, changes in their partners’ configurations raised questions about their motivations. Instead, participants would adjust the configuration for different intimacy levels (colleague vs. partner) rather than different activities when using CLS with the same person."

Even when a textual transcription is available, researchers frequently turn to these recordings due to their rich information content. However, the temporal, unstructured nature of audiovisual recordings makes them less efficient to work with than text. Through interviews and a survey, we explored how HCI researchers work with audiovisual recordings. We investigated researchers' transcription and annotation practice, their overall analysis workflow, and the prevalence of direct analysis of audiovisual recordings. We found that a key task was locating and analyzing inspectables, interesting segments in recordings. Since locating inspectables can be time consuming, participants look for detectables, visual or auditory cues that indicate the presence of an inspectable. Based on our findings, we discuss the potential for automation in locating detectables in qualitative audiovisual analysis."

We thus increasingly shift between the real and the digital world, ranging from losing awareness of real surroundings to cutting out the digital world to truly be in the real one. In this work, we aim to explore the middle ground in between. We move beyond classic VR research on presence and look at everyday ubiquitous technology and its influence on presence in the real and digital world. By means of a focus group (N=6) and a subsequent online survey (N=36), we gathered individual notions of presence as well as experiences and situations in which people move between the worlds. We discuss the need to further explore presence and its dynamics across the real and digital worlds in everyday life."

Inspired by critical design, EyeCam is an exaggeration of a familiar sensing device which allows for critical reflections on its perceived functionalities and its impact on human-human and human-device relations. We identify 5 different roles EyeCam can take: Mediator, Observer, Mirror, Feature, and Agent. Contributing design fictions and thinking prompts, we allow for articulation on privacy awareness and intrusion, affect in mediated communication, agency and self-perception along with speculation on potential futures.

We validate the concept of fabric actuation using a base element, and then systematically explore methods of aggregating, scaling, and orienting prospects for ex-tended actuation in garments. A user study demonstrated that our technique enables multiple actuation types applied across a variety of clothes. Users identified both aesthetic and functional applications of ClothTiles.

So far, only a few approaches to interactive systems for agility ladder training have been presented. In this work, we propose an interactive projection system to support an athlete in performing those drills. To investigate the effects of the location of those projections, we conducted an initial study with twelve participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. We found that while projecting instructions and feedback on the floor was favored, participants who were presented the same information in front of them on a projected screen partially performed better in a subsequent agility assessment."

This workshop will address the challenges of designing interactive systems in the realm of sports from an embodied interaction perspective focusing on athletes' experience rather than performance. We will explore how interactive systems enhance sports experience without distracting from the actual goal of the athlete, such as freeing the mind.

Researchers apply a wide range of measuring methods using objective (e.g., biosignals, time logging), behavioral (e.g., gaze direction, movement amplitude), and subjective (e.g., standardized questionnaires) metrics. Many of these measurement instruments were adapted from use-cases outside ofvMR, but have not been validated for usage in MR experiments. However, researchers are faced with various challenges and design alternatives when measuring immersive experiences. These challenges become even more diverse when running out-of-the lab studies. Measurement methods of VR experience received recently much attention. For example, research has started embedding questionnaires in the VE for various applications, as this allows users to stay closer to the ongoing experience while filling out the survey. However, there is a diversity in the interaction methods and practices on how the assessment procedure is conducted. This diversity in methods underlines a missing shared agreement of standardized measurement tools for VR experiences. AR research strongly orients on the research methods from VR, e.g., using the same type of subjective questionnaires. However, there are some crucial technical differences that require deliberate considerations during the evaluation. This workshop at CHI 2021 provides a foundation to exchange expertise and to address challenges as well as opportunities of research methods in MR user studies. By this, our workshop launches a discussion of research methods that should lead to standardizing assessment methods in MR user studies.

An increasing number of artefacts for reflection have been developed in recent years. However, evaluating if and how an interactive technology helps a user reflect is still complex.

To address this issue, we developed the Technology-Supported Reflection Inventory (TSRI), which is a scale that evaluates how effectively a system supports reflection. We first created a list of possible scale items based on past work in defining reflection. The items were then reviewed by experts. Next, we performed exploratory factor analysis to reduce the scale to its final length of nine items. Subsequently, we confirmed test-retest validity of our instrument, as well as its construct validity. The TSRI enables researchers and practitioners to compare prototypes designed to support reflection."

To that end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with users of fitness trackers and an online survey to study practices in reflecting on fitness data. Our results show that users reported reflecting on data despite lacking reflection support from their tracking technology. Based on our results, we introduce the Technology-Mediated Reflection Model, which describes conditions and barriers for reflection on personal data. Our model consists of the temporal and conceptual cycles of reflection and helps designers identify the possible barriers a user might face when using a system for reflection."

Developing technology that is universally useful and engaging requires knowledge about members of WEIRD and non-WEIRD societies alike. In other words, it requires us, the CHI community, to generate this knowledge by studying representative participant samples. To find out to what extent CHI participant samples are from Western societies, we analyzed papers published in the CHI proceedings between 2016-2020. Our findings show that 73% of CHI study findings are based on Western participant samples, representing less than 12% of the world's population. Furthermore, we show that most participant samples at CHI tend to come from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries with generally highly educated populations. Encouragingly, recent years have seen a slight increase in non-Western samples and those that include several countries. We discuss suggestions for further broadening the international representation of CHI participant samples."

In this context, we found that: (1) a movement space of 200 mm texttimes 200 mm is preferred; (2) each context has a perceived level of safety, which—together with the affordances and link to familiarity—influences how the password is performed. Furthermore, the artefact’s dimensions should be balanced within the design itself, with the user, and the context, but there is a trade-off between the perceived safety and ergonomics; and (3) the designed embodied passwords can be recalled for at least a week, with participants creating unique passwords which were reproduced consistently."

We asked a small number of participants (26) to mimic five basic emotions and used an open source emotion-in-voice detector to provide feedback on whether their acted emotion was recognized as intended. We found that it was difficult for participants to mimic all five emotions and that certain emotions were easier to mimic than others. However, it remains unclear whether this is due to the fact that emotion was only acted or due to the insufficiency of the detection software. As an intended side effect, we collected a small corpus of labeled data for acted emotion in speech, which we plan to extend and eventually use as training data for our own emotion detection.

In an online survey, N=205 participants were prompted with everyday scenarios, and wrote the lines of both user and VA in dialogues that they imagined as perfect. We analysed the dialogues with text analytics and qualitative analysis, including number of words and turns, social aspects of conversation, implied VA capabilities, and the influence of user personality. The majority envisioned dialogues with a VA that is interactive and not purely functional; it is smart, proactive, and has knowledge about the user. Attitudes diverged regarding the assistant's role as well as it expressing humour and opinions. An exploratory analysis suggested a relationship with personality for these aspects, but correlations were low overall. We discuss implications for research and design of future VAs, underlining the vision of enabling conversational UIs, rather than single command ""Q&As""."

While the general application of AR has been shown to provide clear benefts regarding physical tasks, it is important to understand how different visualization types infuence user’s performance during the execution of the tasks. Previous studies evaluating AR and user’s performance compared different media types or types of AR hardware as opposed to different types of visualization for the same hardware type. This paper provides details of our comparative study in which we identifed the infuence of visualization types on the performance of complex machine set-up processes. Although our results show clear advantages to using concrete rather than abstract visualizations, we also fnd abstract visualizations coupled with videos leads to similar user performance as with concrete visualizations."

Based on their work and the artifacts they generated, we found that AR/VR application creators fulfill four roles: concept developers, interaction designers, content authors, and technical developers. One person often incorporates multiple roles and faces a variety of challenges during the design process from the initial contextual analysis to the deployment. From analysis of their tool sets, methods, and artifacts, we describe critical key challenges.

Whether we can apply insights from software development research remains open though, since it is not yet clear, whether data-driven development has the same requirements as its traditional counterpart. We used eye tracking to investigate whether the code reading behaviour of developers differs between code that uses Machine Learning and code that does not. Our data shows that there are differences in what parts of the code people consider of interest and how they read it. This is a consequence of differences in both syntax and semantics of the code. This reading behaviour already shows that we cannot take existing solutions as universally applicable.

We combine a recently invented 6-DOF fingertip device with motion tracking, a head-mounted display, and novel contact-rendering algorithms to enable a user to tactilely explore immersive virtual environments. We evaluate rudimentary 1-DOF, moderate 3-DOF, and complex 6-DOF tactile feedback during shape discrimination and mass discrimination, also comparing to interactions with real objects.

Facilitating robot teleoperation by providing additional visual information about the environment and the robot affordances using augmented reality (AR), can improve task performance in manipulation and grasping. In this paper, we present two designs of augmented visual cues, that aim to enhance the visual space of the robot operator through hints about the position of the robot gripper in the workspace and in relation to the target. These visual cues aim to improve the distance perception and thus, the task performance. We evaluate both designs against a baseline in an experiment where participants teleoperate a robotic arm to perform pick-and-place tasks. Our results show performance improvements in different levels, reflecting in objective and subjective measures with trade-offs in terms of time, accuracy, and participants’ views of teleoperation. These findings show the potential of AR not only in teleoperation, but in understanding the human-robot workspace."

Touch-based interaction (e.g. via mobile devices) can compensate for these drawbacks, but is limited to two-dimensional input. In this work we present STREAM: Spatially-aware Tablets combined with Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays for the multimodal interaction with 3D visualizations. We developed a novel eyes-free interaction concept for the seamless transition between the tablet and the augmented reality environment. A user study reveals that participants appreciated the novel interaction concept, indicating the potential for spatially-aware tablets in augmented reality.

KiTT supports the training of Kinaesthetics-based patient transfers by two nurses. The nurses are guided by the phases (i) interactive instructions, (ii) training of transfer conduct, and (iii) feedback and reflection. We evaluated KiTT with 26 nursing-care students in a nursing-care school. Our results indicate that KiTT provides a good subjective support for the learning of Kinaesthetics.

The actual target group remains unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fits-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer differentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description of HCI applications."

Our basic perceptual research focuses on both the visual complexity of backgrounds as well as the influence of a secondary task. In contrast to our expectation, data of our 34 study participants indicate that the background has far less influence on the perception of AR visualizations. Moreover, we observed a mismatch between measured and subjectively reported performance. We discuss the importance of the background and recommendations for visual real-world augmentations.

Additionally, the simultaneously raised situation awareness could benefit potential take-overs. We report the results of two comparative online studies on visualizing semantic segmentation information for the human user of autonomous vehicles. Effects on trust, cognitive load, and situation awareness were measured using a simulation (N=32) and state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation on a pre-recorded real-world video (N=41).

Unlike previous RE approaches, ReverseORC infers flexible layout constraint specifications by sampling UIs at different sizes and analyzing the differences between them. It can create specifications that replicate even some non-standard layout managers with complex dynamic layout behaviours. We demonstrate that ReverseORC works across different platforms with very different layout approaches, e.g., for GUIs as well as for the Web. Furthermore, it can be used to detect and fix problems in legacy UIs, extend UIs with enhanced layout behaviours, and support the creation of flexible UI layouts."

To add a vibrato or pitch bend, the pianist needs to actively operate the pitch wheel with their hand, which requires cognitive effort and may disrupt play. In this work, we present EMPiano, a system that allows pianists to incorporate a soft pitch vibrato into their play seamlessly. Vibrato can be triggered through muscle activity and is recognized via electromyography. This allows EMPiano to integrate into piano play. Our system offers new interaction opportunities with the piano to increase the player's potential for expressive play.

Virtual reality (VR) allows novel approaches for users to view, read, and interact with a text. However, for efficient reading, it is necessary to understand how a text should be displayed in VR without impairing the VR experience. Therefore, we conducted a study with 18 participants to investigate text presentation type and location in VR. We compared world-fixed, edge-fixed, and head-fixed text locations. Texts were displayed using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) or as a paragraph. We found that RSVP is a promising presentation type for reading short texts displayed in edge-fixed or head-fixed location in VR. The paragraph presentation type using world-fixed or edge-fixed location is promising for reading long text if movement in the virtual environment is not required. Insights from our study inform the design of reading interfaces for VR applications."

Previous work found that avatars associated with physical strength can decrease users' perceived exertion when performing physical tasks. However, it is unknown if an avatar's appearance can also influence the user's physiological response to exercises. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with 24 participants to investigate the effect of avatars' athleticism on heart rate and perceived exertion while cycling in VR following a standardized protocol. We found that the avatars' athleticism has a significant and systematic effect on users' heart rate and perceived exertion. We discuss potential moderators such as body ownership and users' level of fitness. Our work contributes to the emerging area of VR exercise systems."

One reason is the lack of shortcut mechanisms. In this article, we determine shortcuts for text-heavy activities, elicit shortcut gestures, implement them for a fully touch-sensitive smartphone, and conduct an evaluation with potential users. We found that experts perform around 800 keyboard shortcuts per day, which are not available on smartphones. Interviews revealed the lack of shortcuts as a major limitation that prevents mobile text editing. Therefore, we elicited gestures for the 22 most important shortcuts for smartphones that are touch-sensitive on the whole device surface. We implemented the gestures for a fully touch-sensitive smartphone using deep learning and evaluated them in realistic scenarios to gather feedback. We show that the developed prototype is perceived as intuitive and faster than recent commercial approaches."

This research has thrived over the past years with multiple workshops, seminars, and a growing body of publications, spanning several conferences. Given the rapid advancement of interaction technologies and novel application domains, this paper aims toward a broader research agenda to enable widespread adoption. We present 17 key research challenges developed over multiple sessions by a diverse group of 24 international experts, initiated from a virtual scientific workshop at ACM CHI 2020. These challenges aim to coordinate future work by providing a systematic roadmap of current directions and impending hurdles to facilitate productive and effective applications for Immersive Analytics."

Our focus is on groups’ social and shared interactions, in particular how exhibit setup and structure influence collaboration patterns. Behaviors at the exhibits included individuals focusing beyond their personal activity towards companions’ interaction, adults participating via physical interaction, and visitors taking opportunities to interact when companions moved between sections of the exhibit or stepped back from interaction. We demonstrate how exhibits’ physical configuration and interactive control engendered behavioral patterns. Systematic analysis reveals how different configurations (concerning physical-spatial hardware and interactive software) distribute control differently amongst visitors. We present four mechanisms for how control can be distributed at an interactive installation: functional, temporal, physical and indirect verbal. In summary, our work explores how mechanisms that distribute control influence patterns of shared interaction with the exhibits and social interaction between museum visitor companions."
