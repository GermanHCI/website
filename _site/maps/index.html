<p>At LMU Munich, three groups are working closely together in HCI research under the general title “Media Informatics”. All three groups conduct research on the crossroads of human behavior and machine computation. This comprises a broad range of topics, including novel interfaces and interaction technologies, development methodologies, and application case studies – always with a human-centered focus.
The core Media Informatics group (Heinrich Hußmann) focuses on methods for smooth transitions along the mixed reality continuum, on the application of physical sensing methods to improve interaction and learning, and on interdisciplinary research in the interaction between humans and intelligent assistants. An important application area is the automotive domain.
Research in the LMU HCI group (Andreas Butz) centers around the idea of mixing the digital and the physical world. This includes Ubiquitous Computing environments in the classical sense, be they living rooms, handball courts, or the public space, but also our interaction with autonomous cars and robots, and generally the interplay between human and artificial intelligence.
The Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media group (Albrecht Schmidt) explores digital technologies that allow augmenting and amplifying human cognition and perception. The focus is on experimental research aiming at designing and implementing human-centered intelligent interactive systems. Technically this includes work on physiological user interfaces, augmented and virtual reality, and novel input and output channels.</p>

<p>We explore the design of secure systems that blend with the way in which users interact with computing devices. In particular, our research focuses on understanding users’ behavior in security critical contexts, in building security mechanisms based on users’ behavior (behavioral biometrics), in leveraging users’ physiology to both enhance existing security mechanisms as well as build novel security mechanisms (physiological security) and in understanding and investigating threats that emerge from novel ubiquitous technologies (ubiquitous security). Specific application areas are smart homes, social engineering and virtual reality.</p>

<p>In the context of our research we employ and enhance methods commonly known from Human-Computer Interaction. These include but are not limited to user-centered design and iterative prototyping. Our work is strongly centered around humans, making empirical approaches a fundamental part of our research. To understand behavior as well as to evaluate novel approaches, we conduct studies in the lab and in the field.</p>

<p>The group has won best paper and honorable mention awards at CHI, MobileHCI, IDC, and AmI. The research has been funded by the DFG, the ZD.B / Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Science, BMW, the Humboldt Foundation, the DAAD, Google, and the Telekom Innovation Labs.</p>

<p>Volker Wulf – www.wineme.uni-siegen.de</p>

<p>Information and communications technology (ICT) pervades most aspects of our lives and changes everyday’s practices in work and leisure time. To design innovative ICTs we need to engage with practices, institutional arrangements, and technological infrastructures. All of these issues are interrelated and historical grown, they need appropriate design methods. The challenge in the field of human-centred computing is to design innovative applications so that their appropriation leads to a better quality of life, sustainable development, and social integration. We are investigating into innovative ICTs, especially in the practice fields of cooperative work, community support, entertainment, ageing societies, and sustainability. In doing so, we contribute to the research fields of Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Ubiquitous Computing, and Software Engineering. The investigations into innovative ICTs in specific domains are related to each other via cross-cutting issues. These issues are currently ubiquitous and software technologies, methods of participatory design, end-user development, integration of organization and technology development, and the foundations of design science.</p>

<p>Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Media
Volkmar Pipek – www.cscw.uni-siegen.de</p>

<p>We are an interdisciplinary research group of the University of Siegen dealing with IT-supported cooperation between humans. Particularly we deal with questions of the arrangement and acquirement of cooperative software systems in organizations, questions about communication based knowledge management and also with the support of communities. The last topic involves questions of social structuring by and with information technology (for instance in the fields of E-democracy or in civil security). Computer-Supported Cooperative Work / CSCW is an interdisciplinary field of research which includes not only methodology and contents of Computer Science and Information Systems, but also disciplines of business administration, organizations theory, ergonomics, sociology, psychology and anthropology/ethnography. Seen from the view of Computer Science CSCW is a subarea of Information Systems and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).</p>

Thomas Ludwig – cps.wineme.fb5.uni-siegen.de/en/</p>

<p>Our research group is engaged in research and teaching about the conception and design of cyber-physical systems, its technical development as well as its appropriation by users in different fields of application. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) describe the coupling of physical or biological components that can be integrated, observed and controlled via a computing unit. Essential components of cyber-physical systems are information and software technology components with mechanical or electronic components that communicate with each other via a communication infrastructure (e.g. the internet). Today, cyber-physical systems can be found wherever complex physical systems can be improved by communicating with the virtual, digital world. Examples are smart production facilities (industry 4.0) or e-health.</p>

<p>IT for the Ageing Society
Claudia Müller – www.wineme.uni-siegen.de/en/team/mueller/</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that demographic change gives rise to numerous challenges and problems. The teaching and research at the heart of the assistant Professorship are concerned with finding solutions to these issues; solutions which are supported by information technology. The aim is to maintain and improve the social inclusion of the elderly, particularly their mobility and independence, as well as to enable them to lead a comfortable, healthy life at home, even at an advanced age.</p>

<p>IT-Security and Consumer Computing
Gunnar Stevens – www.itsec.wiwi.uni-siegen.de</p>

<p>The Chair of Information Systems, in particular IT-Security and Consumer Computing researches the digital transformation of society from the consumer’s point of view with the aim of increasing digital sovereignty. The chair is located in the new research field of consumer informatics. Consumer informatics is the systematic, methodically guided investigation and design of information and communication technologies to support the household economies and everyday practices of consumers as well as their appropriation and social embedding. Consumer informatics thereby undergoes a change of perspective in which not only the role as a user of a system or customer of a company, but also the individual and collective life worlds of consumers are focused as comprehensively as possible.</p>

<p>The Human-Computer-Interaction Group is located at the Institute of Media Informatics at Ulm University, and is headed by Enrico Rukzio. We are interested in designing intelligent interactive systems that enable people to be more efficient, satisfied and expressive in their daily lives. We design, implement (hard- and software) and evaluate novel interaction techniques, applications and services which either solve existing problems or provide new opportunities. Our research approach is based on design thinking, user centred design and iterative prototyping. At this, we involve potential users in all steps of the process, use a large body of low- and high-fidelity prototyping techniques and conduct a large number of user studies, evaluations and field tests. Our research focuses on the design of novel interaction concepts, devices and applications in areas such as mobile and wearable interaction, projected user interfaces, computerized eyewear, cross-device interactions, interaction in smart environments, human-technology interaction for elderly people, automotive user interfaces and interactive production planning.</p>
